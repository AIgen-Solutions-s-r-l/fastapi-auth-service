# Task: Revert main branch (local & remote) to commit cc34011

**Description:**
The user requested to revert both the local and remote `main` branch to a specific commit ID: `cc3401175dbd78e3e401b9b5fc80dd0309a1ba23`. This requires a hard reset locally and a force push remotely.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   The local `main` branch HEAD points to commit `cc3401175dbd78e3e401b9b5fc80dd0309a1ba23`.
*   The remote `origin/main` branch HEAD points to commit `cc3401175dbd78e3e401b9b5fc80dd0309a1ba23`.

**Checklist:**
*   [✅] Ensure the current local branch is `main`. If not, check it out (`git checkout main`).
*   [✅] Fetch latest changes from remote to ensure local state is updated (`git fetch origin`).
*   [✅] Perform a hard reset of the local `main` branch to the target commit (`git reset --hard cc3401175dbd78e3e401b9b5fc80dd0309a1ba23`).
*   [✅] Force push the local `main` branch to the remote `origin` (`git push origin main --force`). **Confirm user understands this overwrites remote history.** (User confirmation implied by request, proceed with caution).
*   [✅] Verify the remote `main` branch now points to the target commit (e.g., using `git log origin/main -n 1`).

**Notes:**
*   Force pushing can be disruptive for collaborators. Ensure this is the intended action.
