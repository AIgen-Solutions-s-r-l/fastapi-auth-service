# Auth Service - Active Context

## Current Session Context
March 4, 2025, 7:51 PM (Europe/Berlin, UTC+1:00)

## Project Status
Memory Bank has been initialized for the auth_service project. We've created comprehensive documentation covering architecture, code structure, security, and documentation planning. We've successfully implemented improvements to the email system, including diagnostic endpoints, enhanced error logging, retry mechanisms, template verification, and configuration validation. We've completed the update of the subscription tier system to match new requirements. We've also successfully implemented email-based login while maintaining backward compatibility with username-based authentication to ensure a smooth transition. We've implemented Stripe integration for the credit system to handle payments and subscriptions. We've removed the unused SMTP email configuration to simplify the codebase since we exclusively use SendGrid for email delivery. Most recently, we've developed a plan for implementing Google OAuth 2.0 authentication while maintaining compatibility with our existing JWT token system across microservices.

## Current Issues

### ✅ Environment Variable Loading (Resolved)
We identified and fixed an issue with environment variables not loading correctly from the .env file:

- ✅ Fixed the Settings class to properly load environment variables from .env file
- ✅ Added configuration to ignore extra fields not defined in the Settings class
- ✅ Verified that the SendGrid API key is now being loaded correctly
- The root cause was that pydantic-settings wasn't configured to load from the .env file
- The fix was to add proper model_config with env_file=".env" and extra="ignore" parameters

### ✅ Email Sending (Resolved)
We've successfully implemented improvements to the email system:

- ✅ Added diagnostic endpoints for testing email functionality
- ✅ Enhanced error logging in the email sending process
- ✅ Implemented retry logic for transient failures
- ✅ Added template verification functionality
- ✅ Added email configuration validation at startup

The email system now has improved reliability, better error handling, and diagnostic capabilities to quickly identify and resolve any future issues.

### ✅ Subscription Tier Update (Completed)
We've successfully updated the subscription tier system from the previous 3-tier system to the new 5-tier system based on application counts:
- 100 Applications Package ($35)
- 200 Applications Package ($59)
- 300 Applications Package ($79)
- 500 Applications Package ($115)
- 1000 Applications Package ($175)

The implementation included:
- ✅ Updates to the PlanTier enum
- ✅ Database migration to update existing plans and add new ones
- ✅ Code changes to support the new tier structure
- ✅ Testing to verify all 5 tiers are in the database

### ✅ Authentication System Update (Completed)
We've successfully changed the login method from username-based to email-based while keeping the username field for backward compatibility:

- ✅ Created high-level implementation plan
- ✅ Developed detailed technical implementation plan with specific code changes
- ✅ Updated authentication schemas to use email with backward compatibility for username
- ✅ Modified user service authentication methods to work with both email and username
- ✅ Updated auth router login endpoint to accept either email or username
- ✅ Updated JWT token generation to use email as the subject for all new tokens
- ✅ Enhanced JWT token verification to support both email and username-based tokens
- ✅ Fixed email change functionality to issue new tokens with updated email
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive tests for email-based authentication

3. Which of the identified improvements should be prioritized after implementing Google OAuth?
4. What are the priorities for the next development cycle?
5. Are there any specific requirements for backward compatibility with systems that may depend on username-based authentication?
6. When is the complete removal of the username field planned for the future?
7. Should we implement webhook handlers for Stripe events to automate subscription management?
8. Should we add support for additional payment methods besides Stripe?
9. Are there any other OAuth providers (beyond Google) that should be supported?
10. Should we implement account linking for existing users who might want to use both password and OAuth authentication?
